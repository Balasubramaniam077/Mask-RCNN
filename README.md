# Person Semantic Segmentation Using the Mask-RCNN

Mask-RCNN is a deep neural network aimed to solve instance segmentatiom problem in machine Learning or Computer vision.Segmentation can give the apporch for single object in multiple Colour Segmantation.


In this respo i created the custom dataset for person.This repo will give the result of single person can identify by differnet colour Segmentations.

# Dataset:
I Download the dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/karthika95/pedestrian-detection">kaggle</a>.And i used <a href="https://www.makesense.ai/">Makesense</a>for labelling format(polygon).
